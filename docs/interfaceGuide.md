# Interface Guide

[Please ensure the application is deployed, instructions in the
deployment guide here:](./deploymentGuide.md)

Once you have deployed the solution, the following user guide will help
you navigate the functions available.

Upon opening the application, the user will see the following home
page:

Upon clicking the refresh button, the model score updates in real-time.

The Current Patients table displays a list of patients, each identified by their unique `V_GUID`, `Facility ID`, `Registration Time`, and `Model Score`. Users can filter the table by Facility and Urgency to refine the displayed results. Users can also sort by `Registration Time` and `Model Score`.

At the bottom is a chart to see patients by `Urgency` (based on model score) and `Facility ID`. Hovering over each bar allows users to see the exact number of predictions distribution for each facility:
